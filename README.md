# Medicine-recommendation-system
This is a project that recommends medicines and their substitutes based on their use. The system uses a dataset containing drug details such as medicine name, substitute, side effects, and therapeutic use. The system groups the medicines based on their use and recommends the best medicine(s) and substitute(s) for a particular use, along with their side effects.

# How it Works
The system uses machine learning algorithms to predict the best medicine(s) and substitute(s) for a given therapeutic use. The system groups the medicines based on their use and ranks them according to their effectiveness for the given use. The system also provides information about the side effects of the recommended medicine(s) and substitute(s).

# Data
The project uses a CSV file containing drug details, such as medicine name, substitute, side effects, and therapeutic use. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or errors.

# Technologies Used

The project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

    pandas
    scikit-learn
    numpy
# Usage

To use the medicine recommendation system, you need to run the main.py script. The script prompts the user to enter the therapeutic use of the medicine they are looking for. The system groups the medicines based on their use and recommends the best medicine(s) and substitute(s) for the given use, along with their side effects.

The output of the script displays the following information:

    The recommended medicine(s) for the given use.
    The substitute(s) for the recommended medicine(s).
    The side effects of the recommended medicine(s).

The system ranks the medicines based on their effectiveness for the given use and recommends the best medicine(s) and substitute(s) accordingly.

# Future Improvements
In the future, the system can be improved by adding more features, such as drug interactions and contraindications. The system can also be extended to include natural remedies and alternative medicines.

#Conclusion
This medicine recommendation system helps users find the best medicine(s) and substitute(s) for their therapeutic use, along with their side effects. By using this system, users can make informed decisions about their healthcare and find the best medicine(s) for their specific needs. The project is open source, and contributions are welcome.
